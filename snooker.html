      <p>The origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century.[4] In the 1870s, billiards was a popular activity among British Army officers stationed in India, and several variations of the game were devised during this time.[4] One variation that originated at the officers' mess of the 11th Devonshire Regiment in 1875[5] combined the rules of two pocket billiards games: pyramid and black pool.[6][7] The former was played with fifteen red coloured balls positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated balls.[7][8] The game was developed in 1884 when its first set of rules was finalised by Sir Neville Chamberlain,[a] an English army officer who helped develop and popularise the game at Stone House in Ooty (Ootacamund) on a table built by Burroughes & Watts that was brought over by boat.[9]

The word snooker was a slang term for first-year cadets and inexperienced military personnel, but Chamberlain would often use it for the performance of one of his fellow officers at the table.[4] In 1887, snooker was given its first definite reference in England in a copy of Sporting Life which caused a growth in popularity.[5] Chamberlain came out as the game's inventor in a letter to The Field published on 19 March 1938, 63 years after the fact.[5]</p>

      <p>Snooker was invented by a Slough man - Sir Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain, who was born at Upton Park on 13 January 1856.

Chamberlain trained at Sandhurst Military College before joining the 11th Devonshire Regiment in 1873 and being posted to India.

It was in 1875 that Chamberlain created snooker. During the rainy season, young officers spent much of their time in the billiards room, and several of the games they played allowed for gambling. Two of the most popular games were 'pyramids' and 'black pool'.</p>

      <p><b>Objective?</b><br>
      	The object of the game is to use the white cue ball to pot the other balls in the correct sequence and ultimately score more points than your opponent in order to win the frame, a frame being the individual game unit.<br>
      	<b>Scoring</b>
      		Players score one point for potting a red, after which they must nominate a colour for their next shot. The black is worth seven and is the most valuable going down through pink (six), blue (five), brown (four), green (three) and yellow (two). After each colour (the six colours are re-spotted but the reds are not) the player reverts to a red and alternates red, then colour until all the reds are potted. The remaining six colours are then potted in ascending points order, thus finishing with the black.

A player continues until he misses a ball or commits a foul, the players alternating turns. The maximum standard break (the term given to a consecutive run of pots) is 147 (15 reds taken with 15 blacks and then all the colours).

If a player commits a foul their opponent is awarded four points, unless the foul occurred whilst playing the blue, pink or black or hit one of those higher values first, in which case the foul is worth the value of the ball in question.
